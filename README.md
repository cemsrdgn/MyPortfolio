# MyPortfolio
This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website. The website is built using React and Next.js for a dynamic and server-side rendered experience. It utilizes Material-UI for modern, responsive design components. The portfolio includes sections for my personal information, resume, project showcases, and a contact form.
